# Rover_project_for_weeds_detection
## Objectives
Build a rover with sensors and cameras so it can identify and categorize weeds in fields of agriculture on its own. Build a system that can accurately discriminate between weeds and crops. Next, use machine learning techniques to process sensor data in real-time for the purpose of mapping and identifying weed infestations. Build the rover with effective navigation in mind for a variety of terrain and weather conditions.
Combine GPS technology with the detecting system to precisely map and locate weed patches. Give farmers useful information so they can better manage weeds, use fewer herbicides, and increase crop yields.

## Scope
The project will center on designing and building a prototype rover outfitted with sensors such as cameras and, maybe, multispectral imagery. The creation of software techniques for image processing and machine learning for weed detection and categorization. GPS technology is being integrated to enable accurate mapping and navigation in agricultural fields. The rover's performance was tested and validated in a variety of field situations, including crops and weeds. Creating a user-friendly interface for farmers to access and comprehend acquired data.

## Problem Statement
Weed infestations are a substantial obstacle to agricultural productivity, resulting in output losses and increased production expenses. Traditional weed management methods, such as human labor and blanket pesticide application, are frequently inefficient, labor-intensive, and environmentally harmful. There is an urgent need for a more sustainable and precise weed management strategy that reduces herbicide use while increasing crop yields. The current project seeks to address this issue by creating an autonomous rover capable of properly detecting and mapping weeds in agricultural fields. The suggested technology, which provides farmers with real-time data on weed distribution, kind, and density, will enable focused and efficient weed control tactics, ultimately contributing to enhanced agricultural sustainability and profit.
